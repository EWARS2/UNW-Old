Program #1 -- File Statistics APP

Suppose that a file contains a bunch of text.  Write a program that reads in the file and displays the following statistics about the file:

    displays the first and last line of the text (just to validate for the user that the file has been successfully read in.)
    tells the user the average number of letters per word (use a double variable type and round to the nearest 0.1)
    tells the user the average number of words per sentence (use a double variable type and round to the nearest 0.1)       

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program #2 -- File Replacement

Suppose a file contains a bunch of text.  Write a program (much of this has already been written for you) that asks the user for two strings, say string1 and string2.  The program then creates a new file whicj is almost identical to the old file, except that all instances of string1 are replaced with string2.

Program #3 -- Common Words APP

Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer, n and the name of a file.  The program prints the n most common words in the document, arranged in order of their frequencies.

Submit code and sample run for each program.

Each program will be graded on the following criteria.

A. [30 points].  Meets requirements. The program meets the minimum requirements stated in the problem.

B. [30 points]. Logic: The logic of the code is readily apparent and correct.

C. [20 points]. Correct Output: The correct output for each program is included.  For programs with text output, include at least two runs of the program.

D. [20 points].  Professionalism:  The program is desired by an employer. The program demonstrates at least one of the following: the code is elegant, the code runs quickly, the code is simple, the code accomplishes something beyond expectations.
